        <i><u><b>Gohan's Overview </b></u></i>

    </h2>
    <p>
        Gohan, being only a half-Saiyan, is unusual in his values and personality. These unique values and personality separate him from pure Saiyans; as powerful as he is, he does not like fighting much. Gohan is the only Saiyan that does not show the common lust for battle. However, when he is forced to fight, he shows special interest in protecting his family and friends. Like his father Goku, Gohan has a pure and gentle heart. Also like his father, he has the typical Saiyan appetite. Besides concerning himself with his family (and his studies), Gohan has a strong attachment with his mentor: his father's former archenemy named Piccolo. Piccolo was forced to train Gohan after the death of Goku. At first, the relationship with Piccolo is a frightening one, but after just one year, Piccolo admits his change because of the friendship he develops with Gohan and even sacrifices himself to save the boy. Because of this, Piccolo can be considered as a surrogate father for Gohan. Krillin also has influence on Gohan, as almost an uncle/nephew relationship, mainly because Krillin is Goku's closest friend. Though he claims he doesn't share the love of fighting Goku has, Gohan does indeed love martial arts and adventure. It is also clearly obvious he greatly enjoys being a hero.

        </h2>
        <p>
            While training with Piccolo, he wears an outfit similar to Goku's original, with the 'Ma' symbol (é­”) Demon King Piccolo wore. After training with Piccolo, he has a mullet-type haircut and dons a similar attire to the Namek warrior which he continues to wear until the end of the Captain Ginyu Saga,

            after which he wears Saiyan-style armor given to him by Vegeta. He would continue to wear clothing similar to Piccolo's for the majority of his childhood, but his hair trended closer to his father's wild self-cut style. While training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, he begins wearing Saiyan training gear, but again reverts to Piccolo's clothing for the Cell Games.
            
            As a teenager, he alternates between a school uniform, his Great Saiyaman costume, a blue gi similar to the Piccolo clothing (except larger in size),

        <h2>
            <i><u><b>Gohan's Biography </b></u></i>
    
        </h2>
        <p>
            Goku's protests, Chi-Chi home-schooled Gohan to be a scholar until he was four, before Goku took him to Kame Island to introduce him to Master Roshi, Bulma and Krillin. At this time, he is shown as a shy but very smart boy who also has a tail like Goku once had. He is also very sensitive and appears to be kind of cowardly at some times. Goku's brother Raditz soon arrived looking for his brother, and kidnapped Gohan. It was during this time that Raditz discovered that Gohan was potentially far stronger than Goku himself.

During the battle between Goku, Raditz, and Piccolo, Gohan became angry and broke free of the space pod he was being held captive in. He delivered a devastating blow to Raditz, giving Goku and Piccolo time to kill the evil alien, though Goku died in the process as well.

After the battle with Raditz, Piccolo, having seen Gohan's power first hand, decided to take Gohan out training in the wilderness. He left Gohan alone to survive against dinosaurs and other dangers for six months, though during this time he watched Gohan carefully. For the rest of the year, Piccolo showed no mercy as he taught Gohan how to fight. While training, Gohan accidentally looked at a full moon and transformed into a Great Ape. Piccolo then destroyed the moon causing Gohan to revert back into his normal form.

            <i><u><b>Garlic Jr's Return</b></u></i>
    
        </h2>
        <p>
            While everyone on Earth was waiting for Goku to come back, Garlic Jr. escaped from the Dead Zone and enslaved most of humanity with the Black Water Mist. Gohan, who was unaffected due to hiding in a cave with his dragon friend Icarus, is forced to travel to the lookout point to save his mother and friends, together with Piccolo, Krillin and his new girlfriend Maron, who is left at Korin Tower.

            He had to do battle with Garlic Jr.'s henchmen, the Spice Boys, and after taking them down, he had to face his friends: Krillin and Piccolo. Luckily, it turned out that these two were only pretending to be evil so they could free Kami and Mr. Popo. While outmatched at first, after a reunion with his friends Gohan eventually manages to overcome and send Garlic Jr. back to the Dead Zone by blowing up the Makyo Star that was powering the villain. This would be the first time Gohan had saved the world without his father's help.
